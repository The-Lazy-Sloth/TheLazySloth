# The Beginner's Guide to Writing with MultiMarkdown

As a writer, I have tried just about every word processor ever invented. I first started with [WordStar][wordstar], moved onto [WordPerfect][wordperfect], then graduated to [Microsoft Word]. But when I started blogging, everything changed. Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla eeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwww wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeee eee eeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeee eeee eeee eeeeeeee eeee eeee uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uuuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uu uuuu uuu uuuu uuu uu uu  u

I ultimately learned HTML, but it is certainly not the most natural way to write. I have used a number of "blog processors," including [BlogJet][blogjet] and then [MarsEdit][marsedit]. But in the last few years, I have completely converted over to MultiMarkdown. 

It a way of writing that turns minimally marked up plain text into well formatted documents, including rich text and HTML. You can even use it directly with [WordPress][wordpress]. If you are a writer, you owe it to yourself to explore MultiMarkdown.

A paragraph with the word HTML.

And, before your eyes glaze over, it is honestly the easiest way to write *anything.* The syntax is so simple, you already know it. If you can use an emoticon, you can write in MultiMarkd

`function ()`
